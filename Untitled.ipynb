    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of regression analysis that combines both L1 and L2 regularization techniques to overcome the \n",
    "limitations of using either technique alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (also known as Lasso) uses a penalty term that shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, effectively \n",
    "performing feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero. This can lead to sparsity in the resulting model, where only \n",
    "a subset of features are used for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regression) uses a penalty term that shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero,\n",
    "but not to the extent that L1 regularization does. This can help to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity, where some pred-\n",
    "ictors are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression combines both L1 and L2 regularization by adding both penalty terms to the loss function being optimized.\n",
    "The degree of L1 and L2 regularization can be controlled by tuning two hyperparameters: alpha (which controls the overall stre-\n",
    "ngth of regularization) and l1_ratio (which controls the ratio between L1 and L2 regularization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, Elastic Net Regression has several advantages. First, it can handle a large number of \n",
    "predictors, even when they are highly correlated with each other. Second, it can perform feature selection by setting some \n",
    "coefficients to zero, which can improve model interpretability and reduce overfitting. Third, it can handle outliers and is \n",

    "    Elastic Net Regression:\n",

    "Imputation: One common approach is to impute missing values with estimated values. This can be done using various methods such \n",

    "    are not missing at random or if the imputation method is not appropriate for the data.\n",

    "    this approach can reduce the sample size and may introduce bias if the missing values are related to the outcome variable or\n",
    "    other predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator Variables: A third approach is to create indicator variables for each predictor that has missing values. This involves\n",

    "    data. Model-based imputation can be more accurate than other imputation methods if the model is appropriate for the data.\n",
